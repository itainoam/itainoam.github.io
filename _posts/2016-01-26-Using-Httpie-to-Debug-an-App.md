description: Using Httpie to Debug an App
---

[httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) is very useful for genrating web requests
and debugging an app. It is similiar to cURL but the interface is much more elegant.

For example to send a simple get request to localhost, port 3002:

 ```http :3002/sumTable/3```


 The defaulting JSON is formatted to be readable by default.
