description: Jump Easily Between Folders Using Autojump
---

[Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) makes it very easy to navigate between folders in cli. 
It automatically indexes the most used directories and guess which one you mean.

* ```j [folder]``` - jumps into folder.
* ```jc [folder]``` - jumps into sub-directory.
* ```jo [folder]``` - opens folder in file explorer.
