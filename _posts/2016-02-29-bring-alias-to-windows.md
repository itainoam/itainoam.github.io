Many times I found myself missing the ```alias``` shell command.
The top [stackoverflow solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20530996/aliases-in-windows-command-prompt) is somewhat convoluted and make use of doskey.

It turns out it's really easy to do using the excellent [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) under Settings > Startup > Environment.
